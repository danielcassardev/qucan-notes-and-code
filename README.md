# QUCAN Notes and Code
This repository contains my weekly learning notes, exercises, and exploratory code from the
**QUCAN Quantum Computing course**.

It is designed as a clean, chronological record of my progression through Python fundamentals,
Qiskit basics, quantum circuits, and key quantum computing concepts.

Each week has its own folder containing one or more Jupyter notebooks, kept lightweight, 
readable, and well-commented.
